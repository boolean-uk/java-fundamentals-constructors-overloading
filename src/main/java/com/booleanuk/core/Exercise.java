        A class "constructor" runs whenever we create a new instance of a class. You can think of it like a method
        that automatically runs when you create an instance. We can even define parameters, just like we can with methods!

        To create an instance of a class, we use the "new" keyword:
        MyClass variableName = new MyClass();

        If we want to initialise a class instance with some values, we can pass those values in:
        MyClass variableName = new MyClass("Hello");

        The above assumes that the MyClass class has a constructor that defines a single parameter: a String.
